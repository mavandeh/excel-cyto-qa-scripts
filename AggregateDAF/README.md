# AggregateDAF
Pulls relevant information from Cytotechnologist Daily Activity Forms into a tabular format for convenient validation and transfer into a prefab spreadsheet for time-wise analysis.

- Open new workbook
- Import macro
- Run AggregateDAF
- Select folder containing daily activities forms

Note: User will need to correct data validation issues and save the file (incorrect date format, name formatting errors).  User can then select all rows with data from that directory, delete entire row, and re-run the script.
